This directory contains files that explain to others (and possibly your future self) your goals and ways of working.

Examples of files to include:
* Assumptions log - Supports QA and enables a reproducible environment
* Data log - Helps manage project data in order to enable a reproducible environment
* Project specification - Lays out the purpose of the project and the criteria on which it will be judged, which is necessary to validate the project

If these documents are stored elsewhere, like erdm or sharepoint, this README file or the README in the project directory can be used to hold links to the documents.
