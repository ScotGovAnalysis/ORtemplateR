This directory contains R code that tests the R code in your /R directory. Regularly testing code reduces errors.

Whenever you test that a piece of code is doing what you think it's doing, save it here. You might need it again in future!

Refer to https://r-pkgs.org/testing-basics.html for guidance on organising testing as you increase the number of tests that you've saved.
It's recommended that you make use of the testthat package.
